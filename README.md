# Overview
This project is a general-purpose 2D PDE solver for arbitrary regions, with the eventual goal of leveraging GPGPU computation via CUDA and supporting multiple numerical methods. Development is ongoing; so far, FDM grid generation for arbitrary polygonal domains has been implemented.



# Development Setup
1. [Using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
2. Open project using `code .` from Developer Command Prompt
3. To run the main, just execute [build-execute-main.ps1](./scripts/build-and-execute-main.ps1)
