# Overview
This project is a general-purpose 2D PDE solver for polygonal regions, supporting both Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Finite Element Method (FEM). Development is ongoing; currently, the FDM grid generation from arbitrary polygonal domains has been implemented.



# Development Setup
1. [Using VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
2. Open project using `code .` from Developer Command Prompt
3. To run the main, just execute [build-execute-main.ps1](./scripts/build-and-execute-main.ps1)
